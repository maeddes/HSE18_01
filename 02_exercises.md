### Homework

- Try to get Docker running on your local machine :)

Note: Docker for Windows will run on local Windows Hyper-V hypervisor, which cannot coexist with VirtualBox.
They both can be installed on the same host, but not run at the same time. If you need VirtualBox try to install a VirtualBox based Docker environment. In case of doubt, please wait and use play-with-docker.
