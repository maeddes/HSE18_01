### Spring Boot Introduction

- Build a simple Spring Boot Microservice with the following starter dependencies: Web, Actuator
- Run the microservice and test the endpoint /actuator/health and /actuator/info
- Annotate the Microservice with @RestController and implement a "Hello, World!" method, which responds to an HTTP GET request.
- Add some basic "functionality" to make the service react to HTTP GET, POST, PUT and DELETE calls
- Change the configuration to make the server run on port 8081 instead of 8080
